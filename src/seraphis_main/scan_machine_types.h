// - marks the end of a contiguous chain of blocks
// - if the contiguous chain is empty, then the block id will be unspecified and the block index will equal the chain's
//   initial index minus one
// - a 'contiguous chain' does not have to start at 'block 0', it can start at any predefined block index where you
//   want to start tracking contiguity
// - example: if your refresh index is 'block 101' and you haven't loaded/scanned any blocks, then your initial
//   contiguity marker will start at 'block 100' with an unspecified block id; if you scanned blocks [101, 120], then
//   your contiguity marker will be at block 120 with that block's block id
