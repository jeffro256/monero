  * @brief multisig_recover_cn_keyimage_cores - recover cryptonote-style key image cores k^s * Hp(Ko) for onetime
  *      addresses Ko owned by a multisig group with aggregate spend privkey k^s
  *   - Processes multisig partial key image messages to collect key image cores for as many onetime addresses as possible
  *     with the given messages. The algorithm only requires messages from 'at least' M signers to complete a key image base,
  *     which means the algorithm works fine if there are more than M messages.
  *     - The algorithm will attempt to combine keyshares using every available group of messages of size M associated with a
  *       given onetime address, so malicious signers can't block honest subgroups of size M.
  *   - Records onetime addresses that have messages but don't have enough messages to complete their key image cores.
  *   - Records onetime addresses that have messages that record invalid key shares (e.g. because a keyshare that wasn't
  *     produced by the canonical multisig account setup process was used to make a message).
  *     - For each set of messages associated with a onetime address, the algorithm tries to compute the multisig group's base
  *       spend key k^s G by summing together unique 'multisig keyshares' from the messages. If the computed key equals k^s G,
  *       then the corresponding assembled key image base correctly equals k^s Hp(Ko).
  *   - NOTE: this algorithm only produces k^s Hp(Ko). It is up to the caller to add in any 'view key'-related material to
  *     make completed key images.
  * 
  * @param multisig_threshold - the threshold 'M' in the user's M-of-N multisig group
  * @param multisig_signers - message-signing pubkeys of all members of the user's multisig group
  * @param multisig_base_spend_key - base spend key of the user's multisig group: K^s = k^s G
  * @param partial_ki_msgs - map of partial key image messages with format [ Ko : [ signer : msg ] ]
  * @outparam onetime_addresses_with_insufficient_partial_kis_out - onetime addresses that don't have enough messages to
  *     assemble their key image cores, mapped to filters representing the signers who did NOT provide partial ki messages
  *     for those onetime addresses
  * @outparam onetime_addresses_with_invalid_partial_kis_out - onetime addresses with messages that contain invalid key
  *     shares, mapped to filters representing the signers who MAY have caused partial ki combination to fail; note that
  *     we include ALL signers who were members of failing subgroups, and don't subtract signers from succeeding subgroups;
  *     subtracting succeeding signers could allow two malicious signers to collaborate to 'blame' an honest signer for
  *     partial ki combination failures (i.e. by each of them contributing invalid keyshares that cancel when their messages
  *     are combined)
  * @outparam recovered_key_image_cores_out - successfully assembled key image cores k^s Hp(Ko) for onetime addresses Ko with
  *     format [ Ko : KI core ]
