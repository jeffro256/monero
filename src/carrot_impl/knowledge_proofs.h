/**
 * brief: A reserve proof of at least `threshold_amount` which uses FCMP++s and BP+s to preseve privacy
 *
 * This reserve proof has unique privacy properties compared to previous reserve proofs in the following ways:
 *   - The total amount sum of the input set is not necessarily revealed
 *   - The amount per input is not revealed
 *   - The association between key images and one-time addresses is not revealed, preserving sender privacy
 *
 * The threshold amount is the minimum amount the given set of inputs contains, if the proof
 * verifies. The rerandomized outputs here do not have to equal rerandomized outputs in spending
 * txs, which is nice for the holder since they don't have to store rerandomizations. `inputs`
 * should be sorted in key image consensus order.`reference_block` and `n_tree_layers` are the same
 * as if we were making a new transaction spending these enotes. The FCMP++ proof is also
 * effectively the same as a real transaction, except that the signed message is a reserve-proof
 * specific message, and can't be used for Monero consensus. The BP+ range proof is a range proof
 * over C_rem = C_sum - a H, where `a` is `threshold_amount` and `C_sum` is the sum of all C~ in
 * `inputs`. If `threshold_amount` was greater than the sum of the amounts bound to in
 * `rerandomized_amount_commitments`, then the opening against `H` would be a scalar much, much
 * greater than 2^64 and a valid range proof could not be created.
